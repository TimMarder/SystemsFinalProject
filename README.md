A Battleship game in which two terminals can connect to each other the various moves that each side made for each turn.

Each player will have, at all times, access to the stats of each ship that they have, an ASCII grid of their own board, and an ASCII grid of the opponent's board (blanked out, of course).

[Stretch Goals]: 
1. Implement an algorithm to randomly assign ship placement rather than a file being needed.
2. Implement an AI who will randomly attack squares until he hits something, then he'll hit the perimeter at random until that ship is sunk.
