Project: Two Player Battleship
Group Members: Tim Marder, Sophia Xia, Anand Idris

=====[Description]=====



=====[How to Use]=====

Both users type:
$ make
if the program hasn't been compiled yet.

When both users have the compiled program, one user types:
$ ./alpha
and the other user types:
$ ./beta
This is the determine player 1 and player 2.

=====[Technical Design]=====

Topics:
Shared Memory - Savings the hits & misses of the Battleship. Also saving the state of the board.
Networking - Will be major part of the project. Will supply the connection between the two players.
Working with files - Users choose the coordinates of their battleships.
Memory Allocation - Storing stats, status of ships, and names.
Pipes - Sending info about hits and misses.

Data structures:
2D Array - For the board coordinates.

Plan:
Tim - Board and battleship generation. Make handshake connection work between users.
Sophia -
Anand -

=====[Timeline]=====
January 2 - Finalize all plans and create initial files.
January 4 - Make connection work between users. Hopefully make board show up.
January 7 - Make file to terminal battleships generation work.
January 14 - Make hits and misses work.
January 19 - Be able to handle different types of errors. (Battleships too close to each other, same coordinate hit, etc.)
