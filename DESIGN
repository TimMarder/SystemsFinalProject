Project: Two Player Battleship
Group Members: Tim Marder, Sophia Xia, Anand Idris

=====[Description]=====

A Battleship game in which two terminals can connect to each other the various moves that each side made for each turn.

Each player will have, at all times, access to the stats of each ship that they have, an ASCII grid of their own board, and an ASCII grid of the opponent's board (blanked out, of course).

=====[How to Use]=====

Both users type:
$ make
if the program hasn't been compiled yet.

When both users have the compiled program, one user types:
$ ./alpha
and the other user types:
$ ./beta
This is the determine player 1 and player 2.

=====[Technical Design]=====

Topics:
Shared Memory - Savings the hits & misses of the Battleship. Also saving the state of the board.
Networking - Will be major part of the project. Will supply the connection between the two players.
Working with files - Users choose the coordinates of their battleships.
Memory Allocation - Storing stats, status of ships, and names.
Pipes - Sending info about hits and misses.

Data structures:
2D Array - For the board coordinates.

Plan:
Tim - Board and battleship generation. Make handshake connection work between users.
Sophia - Sending/receiving what the opponent's move was.
Anand - The "game" part - asking what move you want, how it hit, the stats of each ship, if something sunk etc.

=====[Timeline]=====
January 2 - Finalize all plans and create initial files.
January 4 - Make connection work between users. Hopefully make board show up.
January 7 - Make file to terminal battleships generation work.
January 14 - Make hits and misses work.
January 19 - Be able to handle different types of errors. (Battleships too close to each other, same coordinate hit, etc.)
